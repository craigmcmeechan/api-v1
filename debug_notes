1. >>> npm install babel-jest babel-core@^7.0.0-bridge.0 @babel/core regenerator-runtime
1. >>> npm install babel-jest babel-core@^7.0.0-bridge.0 @babel/core regenerator-runtime
>>> sequelize-auto -o './src/models' -d trucks2 -h localhost -u root -p 3306 -e mysql 

Finally the following order of operations worked:

delete your node_modules and package-lock.json (maybe this isn't necessary but just start with a clean slate just in case because this is what I did
like ruslankhh said, run the following : npm i -D jest babel-jest babel-core@^7.0.0-bridge.0 @babel/core regenerator-runtime
Now delete your node_modules and your package-lock.json again
Now run npm install
